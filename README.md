### **Data Structures Labs Projects**

This repository contains multiple lab projects developed for a Data Structures course. Each lab focuses on applying core data structure concepts through real-world scenarios and problem-solving.

Each folder contains the source code and any required files (ADT, helper classes, etc.). These projects demonstrate the implementation and application of various data structures such as Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Sorting Algorithms.

### 🏥 Lab 3: Hospital Information System  
A system to manage doctor and patient data using a Singly Linked List. Supports adding patients to a waiting list, assigning them to doctors by clinic name, searching by ID, and removing patient records.

---

### 🎵 Lab 4: Playlist Player  
A music playlist system using a Doubly Linked List. Enables adding audio files and navigating forward and backward through the list. Includes a current pointer for active track traversal.

---

### 🌾 Lab 5: Farm Crop Management  
A farm system managing agricultural crops using sorting algorithms. Supports adding crops, sorting by ID using Quick Sort, and by name using Bubble Sort, and printing all crops.

---

### 🎓 Lab 6: Student Academic Records  
A student-course system that uses arrays and search algorithms. Allows managing academic records, searching by course name (Binary Search), and by course ID (Linear Search).

---

### 🖨️ Lab 7: Virtual Printer Simulation  
A simulation of a printer system using a Stack data structure. Supports adding pages to a paper stack and printing entire documents while managing stack limits.

---

### 💊 Lab 8: Pharmacy Queue System  
A prescription management system for a hospital using Queue data structures. Doctors issue prescriptions, and pharmacists process them in order with tracking for pending and prepared prescriptions.

---

### 🌳 Lab 9: Binary Tree Operations  
A basic binary tree project that supports inserting nodes, calculating the sum of all node values, counting specific elements, and determining the number of leaf nodes.
