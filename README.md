# 📂 Data Structures Projects

This repository contains multiple lab projects developed for a Data Structures course. Each lab focuses on applying core data structure concepts through real-world scenarios and problem-solving.

Each folder contains the source code and any required files (ADT, helper classes, etc.). These projects demonstrate the implementation and application of various data structures such as Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, and Sorting Algorithms.



### 🏥 Lab 3 – Hospital Management System (Singly Linked List)
A system for managing doctor and patient information using a **singly linked list**. Features:
- Add patients to a waiting list
- Assign patients to doctors based on clinic name
- Search and delete patient records by ID



### 🎧 Lab 4 – Playlist Player (Doubly Linked List)
A simple playlist player using a **doubly linked list** to store audio files. Features:
- Add audio files to playlist
- Traverse next and previous audio files
- Uses `curr` reference to navigate the list



### 🌾 Lab 5 – Farm Crop System (Array + Sorting)
A system for managing crops in a farm using **arrays and sorting algorithms**. Features:
- Add crops manually or from a text file
- Sort crops by ID using **Quick Sort**
- Sort crops by name using **Bubble Sort**
- Display all crop data
  


### 🎓 Lab 6 – Student & Course Search (Search Algorithms)
A student-course academic record system implementing **linear and binary search**. Features:
- `FindByName` using **Binary Search**
- `FindByID` using **Linear Search**
- Student and course objects stored as arrays



### 🖨️ Lab 7 – Virtual Printer Simulation (Stack)
A printer simulation system using a **stack**. Features:
- Add paper to printer (max 100 pages)
- Print a full document
- Demonstrates basic stack operations for LIFO behavior



### 💊 Lab 8 – Pharmacy System (Queue)
A pharmacy prescription handling system using a **queue**. Features:
- Record prescriptions from doctors
- Pharmacists prepare prescriptions in order
- Display unprepared prescriptions and process them FIFO



### 🌳 Lab 9 – Binary Tree Operations
Basic operations using a **binary tree**. Features:
- Calculate sum of all nodes
- Count occurrences of a given element
- Count number of leaves in the tree



### 🧾 Lab 10 – Balanced Order BST
A system for managing orders using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** where each node represents an order containing:
- Order Number  
- Item Name  
- Quantity  
- Price  
The **item price** is used as the key in the BST.  
Key features of the project include:
- `buildBalancedBST()` method: Constructs a balanced BST from a list of orders to ensure efficient searching.
- `contains(Order o)` method: Checks if a specific order exists in the tree using the item's price as the key.
